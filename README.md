# Kenya Springs – Web Design Skill Test 🌊

This project is a **practice webpage** created to test and improve my front-end development skills — mainly focusing on **CSS styling**, **layout design**, and **JavaScript interactivity**.

## 🎯 Project Goal

It serves as a personal experiment to:
- Enhance my CSS responsiveness and animation techniques.
- Practice JavaScript logic for DOM manipulation and event handling.
- Improve on real-world design patterns (navigation bar, modals, theme switching, gallery transitions, etc).

- Fully **responsive navigation bar** (desktop & mobile friendly).
- **Hero section** with a looping video background.
